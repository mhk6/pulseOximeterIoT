Heart Rate & Blood Oxygen Monitor
Author: Mohak Dua (dua00013@umn.edu)

Project Overview
This project is a personal health monitoring system that displays heart rate and blood oxygen levels in real-time on an OLED display. It is powered by the MAX30102 sensor, which measures both pulse (BPM - Beats Per Minute) and SpOâ‚‚ (blood oxygen saturation levels).

The system includes:

A buzzer and LED indicator that activate when pulse spikes, simulating an ECG/Pulse monitor.
Cloud functionality, displaying real-time BPM data on a web page via the Particle Console.
Components Used
MAX30102 Pulse and Blood Oxygen Sensor
CVS-2308 Buzzer/Speaker
LED Indicator
SSD1306 OLED Display
Connecting wires
Blood Oxygen (SpOâ‚‚) Monitoring
The MAX30102 sensor measures SpOâ‚‚ (oxygen saturation levels) using infrared and red light absorption. The algorithm calculates the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, providing an estimate of oxygen levels. This is essential for detecting hypoxia (low oxygen levels), which can be critical for athletes, patients, and individuals with respiratory conditions.

The SpOâ‚‚ readings are displayed on the OLED screen, giving real-time health insights.
